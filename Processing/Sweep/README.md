<h1 align="center">Sweep</h1>

<p align="center">
  A minimalistic Minesweeper clone. After watching a video on minesweeper speed runs, I realized I would not be able to set any world records but figured I code my own version of the classic game. As suspected, I figured more elements would be straightforward except for the reveal element after selecting a cell. I used recursion to complete this task. This version has a lot of room for optimization but as a proof of concept seemed like a good start.

## Demo
<p>- Left click on cell to reveal
<br>- Right click on cell to place flag
<br>- Left click on dark button to reset flags
<br>- Left click on red button to reset grid
<br>- by default there are 6 mines within the 6 x 6 grid</p>

<h1 align="center">Instagram Inspired Sine Particle Sketch</h1>

<p align="center">
While scrolling Instagram I saw an ad for what appeared to be a filter effect. In the ad, a user touched/swiped an area of an image and particles would begin floating away from the region. I figured I could code something similar in Processing.

## Demo
<p>
By using your mouse, you can click and drag to select pixels along your cursor path. Next, you click and drag to generate an angle and flow direction for the particles that will be created. A sine function is used to create the particle movement while a 2D rotation calculation for the x and y values is used to move the particles in the desired direction.

## Usage Notes
* Processing 3.5.4
* Ensure the .pde file is contained within a folder of the exact same name
* Ensure the data folder with images is in the same folder as the .pde file

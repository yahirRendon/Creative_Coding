<h1 align="center">Ring Audio Visualizer - Revolve</h1>

<p align="center">
 This is a different interpretation of my first audio visualizer ring. In the original every angle that makes up points on the outer ring has a fixed frequency band that is being sampled for peaks. In this version the ring is being created by plotting points as the angle value increments. This creates a revolving band in the form of a ring.

## Demo
<p>
 Simple add an mp3 song to the data folder and update the song file, song name, and song author within the sketch to see the visualiztion. The royalty free song Dreams from www.bensound.com is used as default sound source. 
</p>
<p>
  Using multiple Ring objects set at different frequencies creates the output below:

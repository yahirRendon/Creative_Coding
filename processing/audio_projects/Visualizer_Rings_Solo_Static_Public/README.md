<h1 align="center">Ring Audio Visualizer - Static</h1>

<p align="center">
While looking up different audio visualizers I came across an image for a ring based visualizer. It used bold colors and created smooth peaks in the outer rings. I decided to create my own version and solved some interesting problems along the way. 
</p>

## Demo
<p>
Simple add an mp3 song to the data folder and update the song file, song name, and song author within the sketch to see the visualiztion. The royalty free song Slow Motion from www.bensound.com is used as default sound source.

## Usage Notes
* Processing 3.5.4
* The Minim audio library is used and can be downloaded from import library section within Processing
* Ensure the .pde file is contained within a folder of the exact same name
* Ensure the data folder with images is in the same folder as the .pde file

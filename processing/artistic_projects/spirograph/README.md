A digital recration of the classic Spirograph drawing tool.
</p>

## Dev Notes
<p>
  The main version of this is under the label of Spirograph Single and has a single gear that moves within an outer gear. A basic UI is also present for changing the gear sizes, gear positions, and the position of the pen. The Spirograph Multi is an example of using two gears that revolve each other and the outer gear. I also created a verson for myself that uses a more advanced drawing style that creates a pretty output shown in the demo section.

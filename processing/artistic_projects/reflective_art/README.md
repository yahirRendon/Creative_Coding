<h1 align="center">Reflective Art</h1>

<p align="center">
  I saw an ad in Instagram for a relaxing drawing up that mirrored a persons drawing. I figured I could create my own version of this. 
</p>

## Dev
<p align="center">
  This project wasn't too challenging and didn't build it out to any significant complexity. 
  I just used some trigonometry to reflect the mouse position when drawing by subdividing 360 degrees by the desired number fo reflections. 
  Additionally, I added the ability to generate automated drawing position using Perlin noise which can be fun to watch.
